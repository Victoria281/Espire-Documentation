This proposal is a continuation of our previous proposal for orbital. Previously, we outlined a basic idea of our article repository to help students. Since then, much has changed in our project plan with many of our initial features being expanded upon and put into practice during the development phase. In this report, we will document the development process of our website and scrum artefacts.
