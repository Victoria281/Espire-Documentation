## 3.1 Motivation 

Students tend to face difficulty remembering important information like statistics, quotes and significant points in essays. This can hinder their academic performance when they are unable to regurgitate such information in exams, especially the A-level general paper and O-level English essay writing. Furthermore, as they advance in their education, the ability to connect multiple points from different articles becomes increasingly important.
## 3.2 Aim 

We hope to provide a forum page that enables students to share, organise and analyse key information from articles or academic writings. Our goal is to create a centralised platform for this area of essay/article storage. 

Through this forum platform, we encourage memory retention and deeper understanding by using innovative features on the page. We plan to add quizzes and flashcard options to further enhance their reading experience of the articles students post. We also hope to include recommendation algorithms that suggest related articles or concepts based on user activity, as well as visualisation tools that illustrate the relationships between different topics or themes.

Furthermore, we hope to enable collaboration between students and academic professionals to share collective insights and perspectives. This will be done through a commenting system that enables constructive peer review and feedback.

This centralized platform will include features such as:

- **Flashcards**: Testing tools for memory retention and understanding of posted articles.
- **Recommendation Algorithms**: To suggest related articles or concepts based on user activity for broader knowledge acquisition.
- **Visualization Tools**: To illustrate relationships between different articles from similar topics, allowing students to contextualize information.
- **Collaboration Features**: A commenting system to provide a community of shared insights, boosting academic growth.
