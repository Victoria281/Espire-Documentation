#### 5.2.1.2 Sitemap
![[SiteMap.png]]

### 5.2.2 Scrum Process

Our project utilises the agile software development process. 
In the project, we have 7 sprints, each comprising 2 weeks.

The method we have taken up is to concurrently improve the design of the wireframes whilst developing the application codes due to the addition and change in the direction of our project.

We also finish creating releases at certain points of our scrum. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Definition of done</span>

The definition of done we have agreed on are:
- Acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed
- Unit tests passed
