| Artemis level requirement                 | The requirement for lift off is a working frontend and backend which is not consistent with a normal project flow | The team will try and complete items for the liftoff and refine them in further sprints                    |
| Video and poster requirement for lift off | A video and poster was required for liftoff which would require completed wireframes  Look at time contraint      | We have created a wireflow of minial items so there might be gaps in the prototype for video demonstration |

#### 6.2 Time Constraints

| Constraint                    | Description                                                                                                                          | Mitigation                                                                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strict time line for sprint 1 | Sprint 1 conincides with exam week and holiday period so there was a surpiringly little time to finish the deliverables for sprint 1 | Other than the required items for submission, we will push the items to the next sprint |

#### 6.3 Technological Constraints
| Constraint     | Description                                                                                | Mitigation                                                                                                   |

| Golang backend | We adopted this project to try out golang but it proved to cause more issues than expected | The team has defaulted to NodeJS to meet time contraints but will try to integrate the system back to Golang |
